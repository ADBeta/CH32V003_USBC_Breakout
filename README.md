# CH32V003 USB C Breakout

## Project Description
A Breakout Board for the QFN Variant of the CH32V003, with pins broken out for
I2C, SPI, UART, USB, and with a USB-C Connector, and an NRST Button.  

This Board has been designed with generic and minimal parts, to make the
production and assembly of these boards easy and cheap for novices, looking to
get into the hobby and/or use the `CH32V003` Chips

NOTE: If using the USB Pins for other purposes, please keep in mind that USB_DM
and USB_PU are connected togehter with a 1.5K resistor. Remove this if needed
